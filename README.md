Smarter Slipstream Mod Manager
======================

This is a fork of [Slipstream Mod Manager](https://github.com/Vhati/Slipstream-Mod-Manager) that remembers which of those boxes you had ticked.
It is backwards, but not forwards, compatible with vanilla slipstream.
In order to go back to using slipstream safely, you need to uncheck all mods in this version and exit it first.
This restores the files to what slipstream expects.

To download compiled binaries, check the [releases](https://github.com/neopryne/mod-memory/releases).

If you already have slipstream installed, all you need is to replace your modman.jar with the one here.
If not, you can get the full standalone version.
